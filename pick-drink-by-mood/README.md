# Mood-to-Drink Generator

A simple web app that randomly generates a mood and then suggests drinks to match — all automatically! This project is a fun way to practice JavaScript’s `Math.random()` method for selecting random items from arrays.

## How It Works

The app has a list of moods, each with a set of drinks. When you click on the button, it picks a mood at random and then picks one drink randomly from that mood’s drink list. This helps practice the core concept of random selection in JavaScript.
